### Intro

From the onset of Coronavirus pandemic, the U.S used car market has seen unprecedented rate of increase in the second hand automobilesâ€™ prices. This phenomenon is mainly attributed to two causes: decreased production by automakers due to microchip shortages and increased demand from consumers returning to work. With prices still surging fast, buying a car has become more difficult, as knowing the benchmark price is harder; I decided to build a price estimator for the potential buyers in the market who wish to know the base price for particular model and mileage.
